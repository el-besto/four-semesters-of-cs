# Exercises from 4 Semesters of Computer Science in 6 Hours
### ForwardJS 2016 presentation by Brian Holt and Mars Jullian

### Purpose
* Practice the exercises given in workshop.
* Gain a better understanding of recursion and simple sorting algorithms.

### Pre-Install
* Scripts and tests are written with ES2015 syntax. 
  Therefore, I suggest using Node `5+` so the tests can run without any silly errors.
* I suggest using NVM, and have included a config file in case you already have NVM setup correctly.

### Install steps
* clone the repo
* run `npm install` 
* run `npm test` to have Jasmine tests contained in `spec/`
